      <description>Monica, The Personal Relationship Manager For those new to Monica, it&amp;rsquo;s a website that allows you to manage your personal relationships. You create contacts and provide information to make sure your encounters are meaningful and frequent (if that&amp;rsquo;s something you care about). You can add information about the contact&amp;rsquo;s significant other, their kids, where they might work, gifts, debts, social media accounts, birthdays, reminders, and even diets. In our busy minds, it can be hard to keep track of so many relevant details, and being human, we sometimes fall short of having great personal interactions with others.</description>
