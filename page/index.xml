      <description>A visitor! Hi, you might be wondering who I am.
My name is Chris Howard. I am a software developer at NASA LaRC, working to make data more accessible, discoverable, and usable.
Have a stumble through my blog posts, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a feel for my personality. I like to solve problems, usually with technology. Here are a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed doing:
 Building classifiers using libraries like Scikit Learn and OpenCV Developing web applications and deploying them to AWS and OpenShift Automating repetitive tasks for others so they can focus on more critical tasks Modeling the relationships between different variables mathematically  If you happen to be less interested in tech, and more inclined toward literature or philosophy, fret not, we can enthusiastically discuss these matters on my Library page.</description>
