&lt;h1 id=&#34;monica-the-personal-relationship-manager&#34;&gt;Monica, The Personal Relationship Manager&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those new to &lt;a href=&#34;https://monicahq.com/&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a website that allows you to manage your personal relationships. You create contacts and provide information to make sure your encounters are meaningful and frequent (if that&amp;rsquo;s something you care about). You can add information about the contact&amp;rsquo;s significant other, their kids, where they might work, gifts, debts, social media accounts, birthdays, reminders, and even diets. In our busy minds, it can be hard to keep track of so many relevant details, and being human, we sometimes fall short of having &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; personal interactions with others. A friend&amp;rsquo;s birthday might be forgotten, we might not check in with our mom as frequently as we&amp;rsquo;d like, and our conversations might not indicate that we truly care about what is going on in a friend&amp;rsquo;s life if we&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten what major life-experiences they&amp;rsquo;re going through. These mishaps might not be overtly bad, but they can prevent us from having truly connected relationships. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want better relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s better, is that Monica open-sources its code and emphasizes privacy. When it&amp;rsquo;s suggested that you aren&amp;rsquo;t being tracked and that your data isn&amp;rsquo;t being sold — a significant promise in an age where everybody is out for your data — it is verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was initially pulled toward the platform, but two pieces of anecdata really spoke to me and cemented my feelings enough to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;em&gt;danielvf&lt;/em&gt; from Hacker News &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14498590&#34;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family -
but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone
from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had
last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of
supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he
actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they
needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) In the book &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a tip for getting the most out of the book is suggested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in
a talk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for
self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had
become one of the most important financiers in America, and he
confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant
application of his homemade system. This is what he does, I&amp;rsquo;ll put it
in his own words as accurately as I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the
appointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans
for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part
of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of self-examination
and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by
myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the
interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the
week. I asked myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;What mistakes did I make that time?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;What did I do that was right and
in what way could I have improved my performance?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;What
lessons can I learn from that experience?&amp;rsquo;
&amp;ldquo;I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was
frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the years
passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was
inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions.
This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after
year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever
attempted.
&amp;ldquo;It helped me improve my ability to make decisions - and it aided me
enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it
too highly.&amp;rdquo;
Why not use a similar system to check up on your application of the
principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result.
First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is
both intriguing and priceless.
Second, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with people
will grow enormously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I could use Monica as a tool for holding myself accountable when engaging with others, in a consistent, meaningful way. Monica could also facilitate the sort of introspection noted above, with its journal, activity, and reminder features. But while this is hugely appealing, I have some concerns. What if there was a breach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;monica-in-the-crosshairs&#34;&gt;Monica in the Crosshairs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A breach would be very dangerous. Arguably Monica stores more information (not data) than Facebook. Where a picture on Facebook might represent an event, its participants, and its location, this is described in plaintext on Monica, making it easier to draw insights. A computer can parse this text much more easily than images. Additionally, since Monica is a privacy-oriented social manager, there is more of a &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; of personal security, which could likely result in far more personal disclosure, in other words the willful release of more intimate details. In some sense, this makes users more vulnerable, personally, if there ever is such a breach. For those that want to draw parallels to encrypted messaging apps, I think the average person is going to write the same content in an SMS as they will a Signal message, and even if not, as of right now these encrypted-messaging apps are far more secure, so the targeting is less of a concern. I will, however, draw parallels to Facebook, because even though Monica isn&amp;rsquo;t a social network, it is in many ways comparable, and can serve many of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s primary functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics of private conversation by definition aren&amp;rsquo;t shared on Facebook, but could be on Monica. Details of a relative or friend in a hospital could be implicitly and explicitly exploited. Drug addiction? Financial or spousal trouble? These are all negatives that could be taken advantage of, or could form the basis of a spear-phishing campaign. Even general data like a user&amp;rsquo;s workplace is often spoofed on Facebook, but on a platform like Monica, people will probably be more inclined to submit honest data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people first joined Facebook because they wanted to keep track of friends and family in the way Monica does. Facebook largely shifted, became less trustworthy, and became more superficial in users&amp;rsquo; eyes. A social manager that is open-sourced and private (where people are actually themselves and don&amp;rsquo;t self-censor), is an awesome alternative to something like Facebook. But it is still worth exploring these considerations before committing large amounts of personal information to a web platform that may be extra prone to being targeted. Is there 2FA? Not yet. What security measures do their staff take when dealing with lockouts or other requests? I&amp;rsquo;m sure more is to come as the platform scales. I would still personally choose Monica over other platforms any day. I just think users should be at least a little conscious of what kind of data they&amp;rsquo;re adding to their page, without assuming it will be perfectly secure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Projecting with Python [GIS, Python]</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-introduction-to-gis-with-python&#34;&gt;My Introduction to GIS with Python&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is a powerful tool in the GIS world, so I wanted to get a little bit of practice with it. I have had a lot of fun working with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/&#34;&gt;Global Terrorism Database&lt;/a&gt; so I figured I would go from its CSV format to one that is better-supported by GIS — the shapefile. The dataset contains information related to terrorist attacks, including attack locations. Each location has a variety of data but I will focus on country, latitude, and longitude. Specifically, I will observe attacks in Iraq. The coordinates are based on WGS1984 standards, so they will have to be converted to UTM Zone 38N in order to be mapped on a flat-surface (more on this later, no worries if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-step-cleaning-the-data&#34;&gt;First Step: Cleaning the Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first get the data, it contains way more information than we need. There are over 120 variables and as noted, we primarily want to focus on locational data and a few other variables like target type, attack type, and terrorist group responsible. We need to get rid of excess so that our script runs faster and is more relevant to our objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/dataset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Global Terrorism Database&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the list of imported modules. Pandas is used first to load the data into a DataFrame (basically a table) to be operated on. Functional programming is best suited for the overall task, as for most data analysis, so here is a simple function to clean the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Cleaning the Data with Pandas Read&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that the &lt;code&gt;clean_csv()&lt;/code&gt; hasn&amp;rsquo;t been called yet, call it. If it has already been called, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Cleaning the Data with Pandas Read&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve cleaned our data and created a DataFrame with most of what we want. Now we can use another function to specify which country we&amp;rsquo;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;second-step-specifying-the-country-of-interest&#34;&gt;Second Step: Specifying the Country of Interest&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we&amp;rsquo;re interested in looking at Iraq. We want to see all of the terrorist attacks that occurred in Iraq. We will clean the frame a little bit more now. This step could have been done in the first function but I believe it&amp;rsquo;s more simple for a future user to read, understand, and plug the country of interest with a separate function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Specifying the Country of Interest - Iraq&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple enough. The DataFrame object from the last function is loaded in and we create a new frame that meets our criteria; where every record&amp;rsquo;s country value is &amp;ldquo;Iraq.&amp;rdquo; Then, any records containing NaNs are dropped. Our coordinate data is still based on the WGS1984 standard — they work on 3D planes, like in Google Earth, but not on 2D planes, like almost every other map in existence. This calls for conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;third-step-converting-the-coordinates&#34;&gt;Third Step: Converting the Coordinates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinate systems use values that assume 3D-space and are provided by satellites. The problem is, most maps are flat, and when you&amp;rsquo;re flattening the earth there are always distortions. These distortions affect distance, direction, and scale. Check out Kai Chang&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/ba569633d51ebec6ec6e&#34;&gt;awesome visualizations&lt;/a&gt; for comparing different map projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematical formulae are used to convert geographic coordinates into their flat-plane equivalents. The Python module &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj&#34;&gt;Pyproj&lt;/a&gt; handles this for users, so I import this module and use it in my conversion function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Python Pyproj to Convert from Geographic Coordinates to Projected UTM&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed I used the UTM projection (Universal Transverse Mercator). This is because distortion occurs at the poles of the earth, whereas the areas around the equator tend to be accurately preserved (due to the sizes of the zones). This is good for us since we&amp;rsquo;re observing Iraq. Iraq falls in the Zone 38N band, and must be used as an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;incorrect-pyproj-value-output&#34;&gt;Incorrect Pyproj Value Output&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I made a common mistake. I was getting pretty wildly wrong values, where points were showing up in Ethiopia and not Iraq. Note the values for utm_lat and utm_lon toward the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection_output1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Incorrect Pyproj Output&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to verify whether or not these values were right, because I knew upon plotting them, I was getting Ethiopian areas, so I used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/toolbox/geography/geoutm.html&#34;&gt;Geographic/UTM Coordinate Converter Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/conversion_site.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Coordinate to UTM Web Tool&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon looking at the UTM outputs, this is obviously wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-139638 != 354377&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;483126 != 410805&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem was that I had the parameters switched. In simple terms, I had p2(latitude, longitude), but I should have had p2(longitude, latitude). It turns out, in many Python GIS modules, longitude comes before latitude. When I changed the order of these parameters, the output was correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection_output2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Correct Pyproj Output&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that all of the outputs are correct, we can go to the final step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;fourth-and-final-step-producing-a-shapefile-with-our-new-data&#34;&gt;Fourth and Final Step: Producing a Shapefile with our New Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a shapefile I decided I would use Python&amp;rsquo;s Fiona and Shapely modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Using Fiona to Create a Shapefile&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous two functions are called:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Convert and Write Functions are Called&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the shapefile has been created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Shapefiles in Folder&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-arcgis-to-map-the-shapefile&#34;&gt;Using ArcGIS to Map the Shapefile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open ArcMap. Go to the Catalog tab and click it. Navigate to the folder. Find the shapefile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Shapefile in ArcGIS&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right click the shapefile. Go to properties. In the &amp;lsquo;XY Coordinate System&amp;rsquo; tab, expand the &amp;lsquo;Projected Coordinate Systems&amp;rsquo; folder, expand UTM, expand WGS 1984, expand Northern Hemisphere, and then find &amp;lsquo;WGS 1984 UTM Zone 38N.&amp;rsquo; Click it and press the &amp;lsquo;Apply&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;OK&amp;rsquo; buttons. Drag the shapefile onto your canvas. And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to go to &amp;lsquo;Add Data&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Add Basemap&amp;rsquo; to find a map to sit under the points — I chose the dark gray basemap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Shapefile Mapped&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the code indicated, I was also recording information on the target types of the attacks. When I use the identify tool on a point (or attack location), or when I open the attribute table, this information will be associated with the geometry (in our case, the point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/projection11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Shapefile&#39;s Associated Properties&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These functions are simple but they have vast implications. All I did was take a CSV with spatial data, filtered out data that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in, transformed the data into something that I could actually work with, and then wrote the data to a shapefile. These processes give me the ability to do further geospatial analysis and to build and deploy an interactive and informative website regarding terrorist attacks. In the future, I definitely intend to take advantage of other Python geospatial libraries for map-making, like Descartes and Basemap.&lt;/p&gt;
