<h1 id="vms-and-containers-for-usability-testing">VMs and Containers for Usability Testing</h1>

<h2 id="dependency-nightmares">Dependency Nightmares</h2>

<p>Have you ever tried to learn a new software, or use a new tool, only to find that dependencies and versions aren&rsquo;t listed, or consistent with your own. Face meet desk. This was a pain I experienced when I first started learning Ruby on Rails, and MongoDB, and the tutorials I found wouldn&rsquo;t work. The experience was so painful, in fact, that as a young teen, I gave up on these tools. How can we avoid this problem when we create our own tutorials and products?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I have found that using a Virtual Machine or Container is a great way of beta-testing your work. Many associate these tools with rigorous scientific work (not exclusively, of course). Whether you hold your own work to the same reproducibility standards is another matter. <strong>But using these tools causes you to start from scratch</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="virtualizing-for-perspective">Virtualizing for Perspective</h2>

<p>When we start building, our mind becomes a bit warped and our perspective changes as the product changes, and often this perspective is very different from that of a new user. For example, when working on a <a href="https://github.com/ckhoward/iNat-SDM">data pipeline</a> for iNaturalist butterfly data to be processed through a species distribution model, our team went into the project with IPython, Miniconda, Jupyter, Ubuntu, and R all pre-installed. When creating the tutorial, we knew Python 3.6, Bash, and R (and its dependencies) were all requirements, so they were listed under the install steps. Then, for the sake of reproducibility, we wanted to build a VM to make it easier for our clients to get their work done.</p>

<p>We built the VM. Following the tutorial, we installed the requirements, and ran the application. No output. Not only did we realize that R (and its packages) had to be installed through Ubuntu, but we also found some fatal—though easily fixed—directory code. The code worked fine in the builds on our side, but it&rsquo;s only because somehow, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed that I created a couple of directories for testing that I hadn&rsquo;t remembered, but referenced in code. My mind just shifted with the product. Lesson learned, using the VM was a great way of conducting usability testing and testing the soundness of our documentation and code.</p>

<p>When building products for other people, we want them to have the best experience possible. It is trivially simple to throw together a Virtual Machine or Container to start where a new user may be starting. As nice as it is to be contacted by somebody using your product, it&rsquo;s not so nice when they express frustration that it isn&rsquo;t working, or that the tutorial is flawed because it was perfectly followed to no avail. Put yourself in their shoes and do some usability testing with a VM.</p>
