<h1 id="monica-the-personal-relationship-manager">Monica, The Personal Relationship Manager</h1>

<p>For those new to <a href="monicahq.com">Monica</a>, it&rsquo;s a website that allows you to manage your personal relationships. You create contacts and provide information to make sure your encounters are meaningful and frequent (if that&rsquo;s something you care about). You can add information about the contact&rsquo;s significant other, their kids, where they might work, gifts, debts, social media accounts, birthdays, reminders, and even diets. In our busy minds, it can be hard to keep track of so many relevant details, and being human, we sometimes fall short of having <em>great</em> personal interactions with others. A friend&rsquo;s birthday might be forgotten, we might not check in with our mom as frequently as we&rsquo;d like, and our conversations might not indicate that we truly care about what is going on in a friend&rsquo;s life if we&rsquo;ve forgotten what major life-experiences they&rsquo;re going through. These mishaps might not be overtly bad, but they can prevent us from having truly connected relationships. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want better relationships?</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s better, is that Monica open-sources its code and emphasizes privacy. When it&rsquo;s suggested that you aren&rsquo;t being tracked and that your data isn&rsquo;t being sold — a significant promise in an age where everybody is out for your data — it is verifiable.</p>

<p>I was initially pulled toward the platform, but two pieces of anecdata really spoke to me and cemented my feelings enough to try it out:</p>

<p>1) <em>danielvf</em> from Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14498590">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family -
but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone
from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies.</p>

<p>I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had
last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of
supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he
actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they
needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) In the book <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></strong>, a tip for getting the most out of the book is suggested:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in
a talk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for
self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had
become one of the most important financiers in America, and he
confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant
application of his homemade system. This is what he does, I&rsquo;ll put it
in his own words as accurately as I can remember.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the
appointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans
for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part
of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of self-examination
and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by
myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the
interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the
week. I asked myself:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What mistakes did I make that time?&rsquo; &lsquo;What did I do that was rightand
in what way could I have improved my performance?&rsquo; &lsquo;What
lessons can I learn from that experience?&rsquo;
&ldquo;I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was
frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the years
passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was
inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions.
This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after
year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever
attempted.
&ldquo;It helped me improve my ability to make decisions - and it aided me
enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it
too highly.&rdquo;
Why not use a similar system to check up on your application of the
principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result.
First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is
both intriguing and priceless.
Second, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with people
will grow enormously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I could use Monica as a tool for holding myself accountable when engaging with others, in a consistent, meaningful way. Monica could also facilitate the sort of introspection noted above, with its journal, activity, and reminder features. But while this is hugely appealing, I have some concerns. What if there was a breach?</p>

<h1 id="monica-in-the-crosshairs">Monica in the Crosshairs</h1>

<p>A breach would be very dangerous. Arguably Monica stores more information (not data) than Facebook. Where a picture on Facebook might represent an event, its participants, and its location, this is described in plaintext on Monica, making it easier to draw insights. A computer can parse this text much more easily than images. Additionally, since Monica is a privacy-oriented social network, there is more of a <em>feeling</em> of personal security, which could likely result in far more personal disclosure, more intimate details. In some sense, this makes users more vulnerable, personally, if there ever is such a breach. For those that want to draw parallels to encrypted messaging apps, I think the average person is going to write the same content in an SMS as they will a Signal message, and even if not, as of right now these encrypted-messaging apps are far more secure, so the targeting is less of a concern.</p>

<p>Topics of private conversation by definition aren&rsquo;t shared on Facebook, but could be on Monica. Details of a relative or friend in a hospital could be implicitly and explicitly exploited. Drug addiction? Financial or spousal trouble? These are all negatives that could be taken advantage of, or could form the basis of a spear-phishing campaign. Even general data like a user&rsquo;s workplace is often spoofed on Facebook, but on a platform like Monica, people will probably be more inclined to submit honest data.</p>

<p>Many people first joined Facebook because they wanted to keep track of friends and family in the way Monica does. Facebook largely shifted, becamse less-trustworthy, and became more superficial in users&rsquo; eyes. A social network that is open-sourced and private (where people are actually themselves and don&rsquo;t self-censor), is an awesome alternative to something like Facebook. But it is still worth exploring these considerations before committing large amounts of personal information to a web platform that may be extra prone to being targeted. Is there 2FA? Not yet. What security measures do their staff take when dealing with lockouts or other requests? I&rsquo;m sure more is to come as the platform scales. I would still personally choose Monica over other platforms any day. I just think users should be at least a little conscious of what kind of data they&rsquo;re adding to their page, without assuming it will be perfectly secure.</p>
