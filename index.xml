&lt;h1 id=&#34;path-distance-analysis&#34;&gt;Path-Distance Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we&amp;rsquo;re a team of highly skilled NGA agents. We just received a briefing about some suspicious activity between two rival factions. These factions are typically hostile towards each other, but a trusted informant has brought forward some intel suggesting the two factions have been cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team must assist in verifying these claims. Wielding the all-powerful eye in the sky — or, an array of US Government satellites — we will first identify which outposts are linked to each faction, and we will then infer the inter- and instra-faction transportation networks. This will prove valuable to our client, giving them direction when choosing what to surveil so that they can confirm or deny the informant&amp;rsquo;s claims — that these two factions are indeed working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two factions are indicated by stars and all of the outposts are indicated with green points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd1.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Aerial shot of two factions within the city&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have this overview. By itself, it isn&amp;rsquo;t all that helpful. We need more data if we want to find out which factions own which outposts. Naturally, being the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, our team has some useful road-quality data associated with the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd2.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;digital elevation model for area of interest&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd3.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;slopes for area of interest&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods-in-path-distance-analysis&#34;&gt;Methods in Path-Distance Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to find out which green points are associated with which stars. You can think of each star as a sort of command post. If we think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s most likely a matter of proximity. You don&amp;rsquo;t want your outposts in enemy territory. So we want to look at path-distance. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t so black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;euclid-s-distance&#34;&gt;Euclid&amp;rsquo;s Distance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euclidean distance is basically straight-line distance. Below, you can suppose that each ring is approximately a mile long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd4.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Euclid&#39;s Linear Distance&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if this method were right, we could just find where the rings intersect, divide the area into two, and observe where the outposts fall. If the outposts are in the half containing the red faction, the red faction owns them. If the outposts are in the half containing the blue faction, the blue faction owns them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd5.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Euclid&#39;s Method in Determining Outpost-Faction Relationship&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd6.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Area being Split by Euclidean Terms&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, paths are more complex. Terrain, wind, road condition, stop-lights, and other elements can influence time to get from point A to point B; you simply can&amp;rsquo;t walk through a mountain. Lucky for us, there are other means of calculating the true distance of paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arcgis-path-distance&#34;&gt;ArcGIS Path Distance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ArcGIS doesn&amp;rsquo;t suffer the pitfalls of the Euclidean method when calculating distance; it comes equipped with a very versatile Path Distance function. As noted, certain environmental factors can slow you down or speed you up on a given path. The ArcGIS function can account for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Path Distance function requires a cost surface, so we will build one. This cost surface is a raster that shows the level of effort required to traverse some area. For simplicity, we will use road quality to account for cost, but GIS software can do a ton more, mathematically incorporating a huge variety of other factors. Intuitively, red areas indicate awful, destroyed roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd7.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Road Quality in Cost Surface&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can then &lt;a href=&#34;http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/creating-a-cost-surface-raster.htm&#34;&gt;reclassify&lt;/a&gt; these data. Values are reclassified to more accurately portray cost. In this case, values rise exponentially to reflect how much more effort is used to traverse the different roads. Using a road under full construction isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. Reclassifying data accounts for the relativity of the situation at-hand, as driving a car down a bumpy road will have a different cost than walking down the bumpy road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd23.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Reclassifying Cost Surface&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd8.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Reclassified Cost Surface&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;path-distance-and-backlink-rasters&#34;&gt;Path Distance and Backlink Rasters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can use our Path Distance function. It uses our command posts (the stars) as input points and it uses our cost raster and surface raster to calculate the cost of navigating the area. It will create two new rasters. One is the path distance model and the other is the backlink raster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;path-distance-raster&#34;&gt;Path Distance Raster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every cell in this raster holds the least cost accumulated. To put this more simply, it says that we&amp;rsquo;re starting at a command post (either, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which). But we want to leave, without having defined any place we&amp;rsquo;re going. So we start walking. Each step we take, we will have a number of directions we can go, some with higher cost than others (because of elevation changes). If we think about this in terms of cells, we&amp;rsquo;re on some given cell, and the cells around it have associated cost values. This new raster shows the least cost path whichever way you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd9.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Area being Split by Euclidean Terms&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;backlink-raster&#34;&gt;Backlink Raster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlink raster is basically a way-finder, from any (and every) cell, back to the origin (our command posts). The graphic may be a complete mess, seeming entirely incoherent. It&amp;rsquo;s actually really cool though. Each color is associated with a number, and each number is associated with a direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd26.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Back Link Raster Directions from ArcGIS&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number 7 tells you to go north, which in our case is the color yellow. And you follow its directions because it is the least-cost path. In other words, your cell is yellow and telling you to go north because the other cells (NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) all come at a higher cost. Think of it as a color-coded way of getting out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd21.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Back Link Raster&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlink raster will be used to calculate the true relationship between the two command posts and the dozens of outposts. The Cost Path tool takes the smaller outposts as starting points, then uses the instructions of the backlink to make their way back to the command posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd20.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Cost Path with Backlink&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Or to make it a little more clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd11.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Cost Path without Backlink&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome. So we can finally see the relationships. In this case, it just so happens that Euclid&amp;rsquo;s method was pretty close, it just missed almost all of the points that were immediately on the other side of the division line. Though it took a little extra calculation, factoring in other variables like elevation turned out to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;inferring-transportation-routes-with-corridor-analysis&#34;&gt;Inferring Transportation Routes with Corridor Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corridor analysis finds the optimal corridor between two points. This is essentially finding the optimal areas of transportation, as opposed to one explicit path. The Corridor tool requires two path distance rasters. Each raster will have least cost paths surrounding some source, in our case, a command post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd27.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Path Distance for Each Source&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two rasters will then be summed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd14.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Summed Path Distances&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This corridor is hardly insightful. There is too much area between the two factions where transportation is low-cost. We can create thresholds to check for smaller values, so that we can narrow down the number of potential routes. This is done with conditional statements. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to highlight lower-value areas and according to the key, the range of data is [7,690-168,354]. These data vary between projects so trial-and-error is really the best bet for finding a threshold we like. Using Raster Calculator, we will first try finding data that is less than 10,000 with our conditional statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con(&amp;ldquo;corridor_surface&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;10000,1)&lt;/strong&gt; — For each cell, if cell value is less than 10,000, write 1 to cell in output raster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd15.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Corridor Threshold 10000&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con(&amp;ldquo;corridor_surface&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;9000,1)&lt;/strong&gt; — For each cell, if cell value is less than 9,000, write 1 to cell in output raster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd16.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Corridor Threshold 9000&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty good, but we can narrow it down just a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con(&amp;ldquo;corridor_surface&amp;rdquo;&amp;lt;8400,1)&lt;/strong&gt; — For each cell, if cell value is less than 8,400, write 1 to cell in output raster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd17.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Corridor Threshold 8400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good enough. If we narrow it down too far, we would be unreasonably assuming that these factions use the most optimal route possible to travel between command posts. This isn&amp;rsquo;t realistic. Fortunately, this threshold served its purpose in narrowing down possible routes enough to be insightful. There are three major bottlenecks that could be strategically used to switch out vehicles when tailing a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd29.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Corridor Overlaid on City&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/pd30.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Corridor Overlaid on City&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our GIS, we have now inferred the relationship between the two factions and the marked outposts. We also created a great deal of actionable intelligence regarding factions&amp;rsquo; transportation networks. From this, we can consider which areas might be at-risk to violence; which outposts are weaker due to having a low degree of centrality within its faction&amp;rsquo;s network; which outposts are likely to be hotspots; and which areas a surveillence team might work most effectively in. This intelligence will serve our client well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visibility Analysis [GIS]</title>
      <link>https://ckhoward.github.io/blog/visibility-analysis-gis/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is intended to be informative, and not so much reproducible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;viewshed-analysis&#34;&gt;Viewshed Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viewshed is an area that is visible from an observer at a given location. The problem of visibility lends itself to many domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a guard on a prison tower must see the entire prison yard to ensure everyone&amp;rsquo;s safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a scout must maximize visibility of a battlefield for intelligence gathering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autonomous vehicles must have 360-degree visibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cell-towers must provide maximum coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will pay mind to the ancient world, where according to Christopherson and Guertin*, &amp;ldquo;fortified sites were often located in order to visually control their territory, sacred sites might be located to provide views of other sacred sites, and the settlement patterns of hinterland sites might be located to facilitate, or to impede, visual communication.&amp;rdquo; In particular, we will be observing and analyzing the Jordanian Umayri Wall&amp;rsquo;s Viewshed. If somebody (that is, say, 6&amp;rsquo; tall), were standing on top of this wall, what would she see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;umayri-wall-viewshed&#34;&gt;Umayri Wall Viewshed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the Viewshed of the Tall Umayri archaeological site. The red star indicates the site, while the white space indicates area that is not visible from the site, and the blue space indicates area that is visible from the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;A Woman&#39;s Visibility when Standing on Wall&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to specifically see the wall, we can zoom in a little bit; the wall is indicated by the red ring. Visualizing what is visible from a given point is a powerful ability. If you noticed, this image is quite pixelated; Viewshed analyses operate on digital elevation models, which are rasters. These analyses will only work on raster data, and not vector data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Umayri Wall, Indicated by the Red Ring&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;raster-calculation&#34;&gt;Raster Calculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewsheds are rasters. GIS allows us to perform raster calculations. In ArcGIS, we can open the raster calculator and use a conditional statement (as shown below) to create a new binary raster; 0 if the cell is not &amp;lsquo;visible&amp;rsquo; and falls within the boundary, and 1 if the cell is visible and within the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Conditional Statement, if visible, 1, else 0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have the total number of cells (not shown), and we have the number of cells that belong to both 0 (non-visibility) and 1 (visibility), we can calculate the percentages of both by non-visibility/total and visibility/total. As shown, about 17% of the cells are visible, while the remaining 83% of cells are not visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Umayri Wall, Indicated by the Red Ring&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-raster-calculation&#34;&gt;More Raster Calculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering viewsheds, a useful raster calculation is combining the viewshed of different points. Returned data is visualized in such a way that you can see what areas are visible from both locations, or either location. So that is what we will do, using site2 (the green star). In this example, the magenta areas can be seen from the green star, the blue from the red star, the purple from both stars, and the white from neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Combined Visibility from the Green and Red Stars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-impact-of-combined-viewsheds&#34;&gt;The Impact of Combined Viewsheds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tying back into the original application domains, to get full view of a prison yard, towers can be added (or raised). To provide full coverage to a city, cellular towers can be added. And to gain &amp;lsquo;full control&amp;rsquo; over ancient sites, they too could put up more towers. So we will pretend they did, and we will see how much more visibility these added towers gave them. Our added towers will be indicated with white stars. Their respective viewsheds are indicated by the varying colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Viewshed From Umayri with 6 Added Towers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get percentages of area covered, we can use the conditional statement from earlier. Remember that non-visible areas will be represented as 0&amp;rsquo;s and visible areas will be represented as 1&amp;rsquo;s. With some simple division, we can see that the new viewshed is far better, with 53% of the area being visible (as opposed to 17%), and 47% of the area not being visible (as opposed to 83%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/umayri7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;The Viewshed from Umayri with 6 Added Towers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this is a significant improvement, it is far from ideal. The towers were added at arbitrarily chosen sites (green points). This step in the analysis could have been optimized for the best visibility, with more emphasis on western sites than eastern, or more emphasis on high-elevation points. This simple analysis can be of tremendous value to any problem concerning visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Working Example of a Conceptual Model</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Working Example of a Conceptual Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Object/Action Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptual models are all about representation. And the way something is represented is important, both when understanding something, and when creating something. When attempting to understand a thing, we try to make sure our conceptual models aren’t faulty, so we practice logic and critical thinking. Else, biases or fallacious thoughts may steer us in a wrong direction while we experience a discussion with somebody, and miscommunications may happen, and/or the discussion is derailed. Likewise, in an early phase of building a product, we flesh out our conceptual model of that product, so as to not be steered in a wrong direction. We avoid adding unneeded features early. We explicate the most essential features and stay focused on them, that way we can get a clear picture of the relationships between our objects and their functionalities, if multiple actions in an app can use the same functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining a conceptual model early will inform UI design in a way that avoids redundancy and it can keep people on track, so they don’t design and implement unneeded features. And when the design phase starts, it will be more efficient. Prototyping can begin earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of a hypothetical Object/Action analysis before designing an email system. I am posting this because there are not a great number of examples online for this kind of thing. This example will consist of a first version and a final version; in our first versions of these models, it is very easy to add excessive features and to needlessly complicate things. For this reason, as with most works, it is often necessary to go back and revise. Cut. Cut. Cut. Until the conceptual model is as simple as can be and represents the absolute bare-bones of the application you have in mind, trim all excess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-draft-flawed&#34;&gt;First Draft (Flawed):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mailbox&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Owner, Current Focus, Inbox,   Starred, Sent, Draft, Spam, Trash&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Examine, Compose, Delete, Mark as   Read, Search, Archive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mail Message&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sender, Recipient, Date, Subject,   Content, Attachment Description (if any)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Compose, Delete, Print, Reply, Forward, Report, Block&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the first version is often flawed, and should be iterated on. The second table illustrates edits that were made to the first table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-draft&#34;&gt;Final Draft:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mailbox&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;User, Current Focus, &lt;s&gt;Inbox, Starred, Sent, Draft, Spam, Trash&lt;/s&gt;, +Mail Message&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Examine, &lt;s&gt;Compose, Delete, Mark   as Read&lt;/s&gt;, Search, &lt;s&gt;Archive&lt;/s&gt; +Organize&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Message&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;s&gt;Sender, Recipient&lt;/s&gt;, +User, Date, Subject,   Content, Attachment Description (if any)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;s&gt;Compose&lt;/s&gt;, +Send, Delete, Print, &lt;s&gt;Reply,   Forward, Report, Block&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;User&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Name, Address&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Examine, Message, Add, Remove&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mailbox:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Attributes, I’ve crossed out Inbox, Starred, Sent, Draft, Spam, and Trash because they are not fundamental to the object and operations. I also replaced ‘Owner’ with ‘User’ as it interacts better with the Mail Message object (describing creator and receiver of messages). I also added Mail Message because they are contained (fundamentally) within the mailbox. I’ve added Organize to the operations because it is a verb that summarizes multiple actions: Delete is organizing into a Trashcan, Archiving is organizing, and placing into Spam and Drafts are also both organizing actions. I removed Compose because it is not essential to the mailbox itself; I only considered it an operation because there is a compose button in the CatMail interface, in other words, because of an implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;s&gt;Mail&lt;/s&gt; Message (to be concise):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For attributes, I’ve removed Sender and Recipient and replaced both with User. For Operations, I removed Compose, Reply, and Forward; Send is an operation that condenses all of these actions, that isn’t implementation-based. Forward and Block were removed because they do not have a fundamental link to messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;User:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For attributes, I’ve added Name and Address because they are user properties. For operations, I added Examine, Message, Add, and Delete because these simple terms can represent addition to lists (like report or block, reply list, forward list, etc.), and users are obviously attached to messages (and the mailbox is owned by the user, too).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Education at Random</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-160-hour-1-500-4-000-mistake&#34;&gt;A 160-hour, $1,500-4,000 mistake.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re picking classes for next semester. You have four selected, and you&amp;rsquo;re now looking for a fifth. There are three options. How do you know which to pick? They&amp;rsquo;re equally interesting, albeit different routes, and they have different professors. The fact of the matter is, you have little information to base your choice off of. Likely no syllabus. Likely no knowledge of the professor. And likely no real insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-are-really-only-a-few-routes-to-try-to-get-more-information-in-these-regards&#34;&gt;There are really only a few routes to try to get more information in these regards.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;em&gt;Rate my Professor&lt;/em&gt;: This is a weak option. The site has declined in popularity and has a word-count to keep posts concise, which basically leads to &amp;lsquo;it was good&amp;rsquo;-esque responses from students. There is no room for specificity. There is no room for discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask around: This is not a viable option. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly inefficient, and even if you manage to find somebody that had a particular class, the lack of a relationship and the spontaneity of the question will likely result in a poorly- and rashly-thought out response. I think people would articulate their experiences better in an online platform, devoid of awkward social encounters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request a syllabus: I don&amp;rsquo;t know why syllabi aren&amp;rsquo;t more accessible. I&amp;rsquo;ve often wanted to see what would be covered in a class, only to not be able to find a syllabus. And I&amp;rsquo;ve had experiences where I have emailed a professor multiple times for one, only for no response. Then I&amp;rsquo;ve even gone to the program adviser to get a copy of a course syllabus, which was also not helpful. Still, even if I did get one, there is a great deal of information that would be lacking. Learning experiences (and teaching styles) tend to be more nuanced than syllabi content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we need a new site to facilitate &lt;em&gt;insightful&lt;/em&gt; discussions about courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-i-mean-by-insightful&#34;&gt;What do I mean by insightful?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a particular student took Course &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; alongside Course &amp;lsquo;H&amp;rsquo;. This student found that the courses complemented each other unexpectedly, and extraordinarily. She was able to build parallels between two disciplines, and find much more meaning in both subjects. This information would surely be beneficial to students selecting their classes for the next semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe one professor talks very quietly and has illegible handwriting. Some professors assign homework and classwork that don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any real-world application, discouraging students from pursuing the field further. If a professor killed this student&amp;rsquo;s dreams with their choices in assignments, that might be significant information; it could cause a student to change major (and likely, career), but it could also be a tremendous waste of time and money (yay, tuition!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will always get insubstantial reviews. Students will irrationally pin blame on professors, failing to take responsibility for their own lack of effort or whatever. You might even get advertisements of some sort: Take this CLASS with PROFESSIRE MIRANDA, you&amp;rsquo;ll have your dream career in ONE MONTH!! But people can use their intuition to judge the quality of a review for themselves. Given the advent of spam filters and verification methods, this is trivial. Less trivial, schools could try to sabotage each other&amp;rsquo;s programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site would be relatively simple. Create a database of schools. Allow somebody to post a review about a program or class for a particular school. If somebody is interested in a program or class that has yet to be posted, they can create a request. A school might be inclined to use alumni mailing-lists to try to fulfill a request (though admittedly, this might ignore important groups, like those that switched programs, or dropped out). The community can respond to different reviews; it would be useful to have the ability to ask more questions, or to agree/disagree with a post, or to give relevant feedback (like a professor switching school).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; the core functionality is post, request, and discuss. +1 for allowing anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;would-the-site-be-successful&#34;&gt;Would the site be successful?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a natural incentive for universities to subtly promote a website like this—if you have a great neuroscience program, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you want the world to know? That would be a great way to instill confidence in students to travel and pay ridiculous out-of-state tuition. It would then be beneficial for students and the school itself to not force the hand of students in completing these sorts of class/professor-reviews. End-of-grade bonus points would get the participation of students that may not have anything valuable or insightful to contribute. It&amp;rsquo;s best if the students post &lt;em&gt;if they want to&lt;/em&gt;, if they really feel compelled. Of course, that requires knowledge of the site&amp;rsquo;s existence, and a student that wants to participate. I&amp;rsquo;m sure many wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to share their experiences, even if others would find them useful. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe a site like this would be difficult to market. It would just need a mission statement that students can identify and connect with. Like not leaving education up to chance, by making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;blog/terrorist-targets-exploratory/&#34;&gt;Terrorist Targets&lt;/a&gt; is a brief exploratory analysis on the targets of some elected terrorist organizations. The dataset was taken from The Global Terrorism Database. A histogram was created to look at which entities were the most popular targets that terrorists choose to attack. From there, mosaic plots are made to show the differences in terrorist organizations, not only in who they attack, but also in how they carry out that attack. This is the one project that code will not be posted for, in the name of academic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. I live in Tucson, Arizona, and I do data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this site as a means to learn. I find it to be a useful way to articulate my thoughts, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that the social element helps with retention. If I talk to somebody about something I just read, it becomes more ingrained in memory. While blogging can be audienceless and is written rather than spoken, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to acheive the same social effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I will use the projects page to hold myself accountable for starting &lt;em&gt;and finishing&lt;/em&gt; more projects. Maybe somebody will see something they like. Maybe I will get constructive criticism. Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to inspire readers at least a little bit, and improve my communication skills in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to write about politics, mind, terrorism, cyber-security, disinformation, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Analyses:&lt;/strong&gt; statistical, geospatial, linguistic, and network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt; Python, R, JavaScript (d3.js), ArcGIS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wanna get in touch?&lt;/strong&gt; Send me a message at christopherh@email.arizona.edu&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Terrorist Targets [Exploratory]</title>
      <link>https://ckhoward.github.io/blog/terrorist-targets-exploratory/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you were to start some Google searches for terrorist attacks, while specifying the terrorist organization (e.g. Boko Haram, or the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Resistance Army), you will likely see different themes within the listed results. Going to a page that aggregates LRA attacks, you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/LRA aggregation.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;lracrisistracker.com&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and for Boko Haram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/bokoharamv2.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;breakingnews.com - sadly shut down 12/31/16&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming these sources weren&amp;rsquo;t cherry-picked, we might infer that the LRA tends to attack people and their property, with assault rifles, while Boko Haram might be more likely to attack crowded public places, with explosives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see how accurately media reporting reflects actual data. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.start.umd.edu/data-tools/global-terrorism-database-gtd&#34;&gt;Global Terrorism Database&lt;/a&gt; provides a large dataset that we can use to explore attacks, containing variables like terrorist organization involved, location, target, means of attack (like weapon detail), and many others. This database will give us the means of exploring terrorism, particular terrorist organizations, and their similarities and differences. Providing this context for particular groups, we can see the proportions of targeted groups. It mostly comes down to private citizens and &lt;em&gt;the establishment&lt;/em&gt; (business, military, police, and government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/target_frequency.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Frequency of Attack on Indicated Target&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these are the primary targets in terrorist attacks; how do individual groups play into this? To compare relatively diverse groups, we can factor in different regions, or groups within different affiliations and alliances (e.g., some branches may be associated with the Islamic State, and some may not be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/targets.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Terrorist Targets&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/attack_type.png&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Terrorist Attack Types&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these two charts, we can see striking differences in who they attack and how they carry out the attack, possibly pointing to different objectives, structures of leadership, and resources. The data reflects what the media observed earlier: the LRA kidnaps and assaults citizens, and Boko Haram uses explosives frequently, though they do still favor armed assaults. But why is there such a significant difference between the Kurdistan Workers&amp;rsquo; Party (the PKK), notably attacking the establishment, while the LRA attacks people? These are rhetorical questions—answers exist, but they are outside the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at high levels of hostage taking (kidnapping) and armed assault by the LRA, this may be an indicator that they use these means as a primary &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iiss.org/en/topics/terrorism/how-kidnapping-funds-terrorism-d704&#34;&gt;source of income&lt;/a&gt;. The logs above show citizens&amp;rsquo; homes being looted. We could look further to see if the noted abductions have ransoms attached, or if it is primarily means of recruitment. Since Boko Haram&amp;rsquo;s assaults are comparable to the LRA&amp;rsquo;s, it may be interesting to show whether or not Boko Haram&amp;rsquo;s tendencies shifted after splitting; part went into ISIL&amp;rsquo;s West Africa branch, while the other joined an al-Qaida branch. If these attacks are the LRA&amp;rsquo;s source of income, it is non-sustainable. If the primary objective isn&amp;rsquo;t gains in income and recruitment, and it is to establish power to rule over citizens, that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK on the otherhand primarily attacks military, police, business, and government targets. It makes more sense that these attacks are politically motivated rather than financially motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Alternative Possibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivations may not correlate well with actions. Explosives are commonly used, so even if a target is a military convoy or building, there may be civilian casualties within range of the explosion. A terrorist organization&amp;rsquo;s leadership may intend to carry out a strategy for acheiving some goal, but if leadership has little control over its followers, attacks may be carried out that do not follow strategy. This could prompt further investigation into the structures of these terrorist organizations, whether they&amp;rsquo;re more network-like, or more heirarchical. Both have their own &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hsaj.org/articles/122&#34;&gt;pros and cons&lt;/a&gt;, but these structures can have significant influences on recruitment, efficiency of attacks, safety of its members, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
